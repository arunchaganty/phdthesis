At this point, it seems like we are at about 6-7 pages:
Abstract+Intro = 1page
Estimators = 1 page
Model = 1 page
Data = 1-1.5 page.
Evaluation = 1.5-2 pages
Related work = 1/2 page
Discussion = 1/2 page

# Measuring bias? = 1.5 pages -- (basically critique what's out there.)
# Might be a little harder.
