\chapter{\label{chap:setup} Background}
We begin this chapter by looking at the rich history of evaluation methodologies within the field of NLP.\@
We then review key concepts from statistics, like bias and variance, that will allow us to formally design evaluation methodologies.
Finally, we close this chapter by covering some of the popular evaluation metrics used in summarization tasks.
