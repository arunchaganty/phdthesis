Linguistic notions of structure.
Thematic progression.
Bad at cohesion.

I kinda want to use Barbara Plank's \citep{plank16nonstandard} work as an example of how we need to evaluate our NLP systems out in the wild, and on-demand evaluation lets us do this. It certainly has for coreference and NER, but I don't know if we can extend that argument.
