On the MS MARCO task, a majority of responses from systems were actually correct but poorly scored according to ROUGE-L.

\contentsline {table}{\numberline {4.2}{\ignorespaces A summary of the key statistics, human metric variance ($\sigma ^2_f$) and annotator variance ($\sigma ^2_a$) for different datasets, CNN/Daily Mail (CDM) and MS MARCO in our evaluation benchmark. We observe that the relative variance ($\gamma $) is fairly high for most evaluation prompts, upper bounding the data efficiency on these tasks. A notable exception is the \texttt {Edit} prompt wherein systems are compared on the number of post-edits required to improve their quality. \relax }}{12}{table.caption.26}
